# Breast_Cancer_Diagnosis_using_Deep_Learning
In this Python project, we developed the network CancerNet and learned how to build a breast cancer classifier using the IDC dataset (containing histology images for Invasive Ductal Carcinoma). To do the same, we made advantage of Keras. I hope this Python project is enjoyable.
